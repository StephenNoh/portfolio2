								<h2>My story</h2>
								<p>It took me a while to find programming, but I know now that it is a great fit for me. </p>
								<p>I first learned about programming using my graphing calculator back in seventh grade. I spent most of my time in class programming text-based games in TI-BASIC for my friends to play instead of listening to my teachers. I was a bit obsessed with my coding projects, but I was pushed into pursuing law school and coding got set to the side. </p>
								<p>It turns out that law was not the right fit for me. I found very quickly that I like working in collaborative environments much more than arguing with lawyers all day. I started working at non-profits and traveling around the country leading volunteers through various AmeriCorps programs. </p>
								<p>Next, I taught myself how to be a journalist. I helped a bunch of fledgling websites take off, including The Athletic and PokerNews. I was one of the first employees at both companies, and the one thing that both of those places had in common was that we were all willing to go the extra mile to make things work. Both sites are now pinnacles in their industries. </p>
								<p>I also taught myself how to become a serious poker player as a side hustle. I have been playing roughly 20-30 hours per week and making money at it every year since 2008. </p>
								<p>These career choices have all shown me what I value. I like helping people solve problems. I like collaboration. I don’t back down from big challenges. And I love teaching myself how to become an expert in a field. Programming gives me an opportunity to do all of the above.</p>
								<p>Coding was an early passion of mine, and the pandemic has given me a chance to dive back into it. I love putting in the work and seeing things grow from nothing. I’ve learned a lot, and I am eager to keep on getting better every single day. I’m now seeking a full-time role where we can work together to create amazing things. </p>
